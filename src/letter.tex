\opening{Dear Professor Englmair,}
I am writing to express my interest in the PhD position on \emph{Latent Thermal Energy Storage for Safe and Flexible Cooling Systems} at DTU Construct. I recently completed my PhD in Solid Mechanics and Structures at the University of Trento, Italy, where my research focused on coupled thermo-mechanical modeling, lattice and composite structures, and multi-physics simulations.

My doctoral work combined computational modeling, finite element analysis, and experimental validation to optimize the performance of functionally graded materials under thermal and mechanical loads. I have developed parametric and HPC-based frameworks to simulate heat transfer, energy dissipation, and structural integrity, and I have conducted prototype testing with integrated sensor measurements. This experience aligns closely with the objectives of your project, particularly in designing laboratory experiments, developing digital twins, and performing data-driven analysis for energy storage applications.

In addition to my PhD research, I have authored multiple peer-reviewed journal papers and conference proceedings on material optimization, thermal and mechanical performance, and ML-assisted design of lattice and composite structures. My background also includes molecular dynamics simulations, system modeling using Python, and experimental instrumentation—all relevant for the measurement, monitoring, and control of phase change materials in cooling systems.

I am particularly drawn to this project’s combination of experimental, computational, and system-level work, as well as the international collaboration opportunities, including the research stay at NTNU. I am confident that my expertise in thermo-mechanical simulations, prototype testing, and system modeling can contribute effectively to advancing latent thermal energy storage for flexible and sustainable cooling.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be delighted to provide further information or discuss my qualifications in more detail. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to DTU Construct’s cutting-edge research in energy-efficient cooling technologies.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
