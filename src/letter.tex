\begin{letter}{To Whom It May Concern}

\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}

I am a mechanical engineer with a Ph.D. in Solid Mechanics and Structures from the University of Trento, Italy. My research and professional experience have provided me with a broad set of skills in mechanical design, structural analysis, computational modeling, and prototyping.

During my studies and collaborations, I have gained experience in finite element analysis, multi-physics simulations, CAD-based mechanical design, and molecular dynamics modeling. I have also participated in industrial projects involving CFD, heat transfer, and two-phase flow simulations, alongside prototype testing and validation in laboratory and production environments. This combination of computational and experimental work has allowed me to develop practical solutions that are robust, manufacturable, and performance-driven.

I am proficient in Python, MATLAB, Julia, and C++, with experience in automating workflows, data processing, and integrating simulation results into design decisions. My work has involved collaboration with multidisciplinary teams, producing technical documentation, and supporting installation, testing, and validation of mechanical systems.

I am interested in contributing my expertise to industrial or research-oriented projects, particularly those that involve mechanical design, simulation, and system optimization. I am confident that my skills and experience can support a wide range of engineering challenges and provide valuable insights for innovative solutions.

Thank you for considering this letter. I would be pleased to provide further details about my experience and qualifications upon request.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
